# systemd_web_interface
Web Interface to SystemD, made beautiful with ExtJS framework

Sorry if the code is really unclean and horrible. I'm still pretty new to javascript, and probably just never really got good with shell. 
Probably could've used php or something, but...

This works on my system. Might or Might Not work on yours.
